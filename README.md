# Learning Materials for Developers

This repository contains learning resources of various programming topics that I've either consumed or planning to consume in the future. I created the repository as a reference for myself and for anyone else who's looking for free and good quality learning content on the internet.

## Structure

Learning resource files can be found in the [resources folder](https://github.com/creatorX64/learning-materials/tree/master/resources).

Each learning resource file is split into two categories: **Lessons** and **Walkthroughs**.

1. **Lessons** consist of learning materials that deliver explicit instruction of the subject matter. These resources *might not* include a coding project.

2. **Walkthroughs** are code-alongs that revolve around an objective of building a specific application. In most of these materials, instructors teach the content along the way. However, there *might* be resources that don't explain every single thing.

## Variety

Currently, the repository only includes learning resources for React. However, I have dozens of plain-text files on my local machine that I've been accumulating over the last 2-3 years. These plain-text files include links that point to free and good quality learning resources. I am still in the process of converting my text-based links into more readable and accessible markdown format. As I convert more variety of resources in this fashion, I will be pushing them into this repository periodically.

Note that all of the resources are hard links to YouTube videos/playlists, but I might include resources of different medium (books, articles, podcasts, etc.) in the future.

## Contribute

If you encounter broken links or if you would like to recommend other learning resources to be added to the lists, I kindly ask you to create a pull request. It might take me a couple of days to review and merge recommendations.
